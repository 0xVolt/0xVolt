## Hello. My name is Desh Iyer.

I am a B.Tech CSE Hons. student specialising in AI/ML at UPES, Dehradun, due to graduate in 2024. I am passionate about HCI and the possibilities of positively influencing the world around us with machine learning. This `README` is a list of all the repositories of code pertaining to a multitude of domains. These repos are either on my GitHub or on other sites.

## 2. Computational Notebooks

### 2.1. Machine Learning and EDA
| **Repository** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [mall-sensor-occupancy-analytics](https://github.com/0xVolt/mall-sensor-occupancy-analytics) | A repository to perform the lowest level of data analytics humanely possible on data from an Arduino project that doesn't yet work |
| [telecom-churn-rate-analysis ](https://github.com/0xVolt/telecom-churn-rate-analysis) | This repository contains analysis of the Telecom Churn Dataset, exploring customer behavior patterns and predicting churn using machine learning techniques |
| [DNASCANNER](https://github.com/0xVolt/DNASCANNER) | An all-in-one tool that effectively performs text analysis on DNA sequences |
| [loan-eligibility](https://github.com/0xVolt/loan-eligibility) | A repository to build a predictive model to automate the process of targeting the right applicants for a loan |
| [exoplanet-analysis](https://github.com/0xVolt/exoplanet-analysis) | An exploratory analysis of data from NASAs Exoplanet Archive |
| [fraud-detection](https://github.com/0xVolt/fraud-detection) | This minor project in machine learning deals with fraud detection of credit card details. It's got exploratory data analysis and data visualisation |

### 2.2. Deep Learning
| **Repository** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [create-deep-learning-environments](https://github.com/0xVolt/create-deep-learning-environments) | A repository that documents the right way to create virtual environments and link them to Jupyter kernels for deep learning projects |
| [neural-networks-from-scratch](https://github.com/0xVolt/neural-networks-from-scratch) | A repository documenting the fundamental mathematics and programming that goes into building a neural netowork from scratch in Python |
| [train-and-save](https://github.com/0xVolt/train-and-save) | A repository that documents how a model is trained in one notebook and it's weights exported and loaded into another notebook with Pytorch. The example is a BERT model for document classification |
| [splice-and-dice](https://github.com/0xVolt/splice-and-dice) | Modularizing Multi-Source Text Summarization with Transformer-based Deep Learning and NLP techniques in a Web Application |
| [deepfit-esque](https://github.com/0xVolt/DNASCANNER) | An AI driven pose detection program that implements an easy scalable algorithm to counts bicep curls |

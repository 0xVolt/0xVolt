## Hello. My name is Desh Iyer.

I am a B.Tech CSE Hons. student specialising in AI/ML at UPES, Dehradun, due to graduate in 2024. I am passionate about HCI and the possibilities of positively influencing the world around us with machine learning. This `README` is a list of all the repositories of code pertaining to a multitude of domains. These repos are either on my GitHub or on other sites.

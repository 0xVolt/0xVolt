## Experience

**Belle II Grid Computing and R&D Collaborator**
  ~ 27/03/2023 - Present

*High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation (KEK)*
  ~ *Remote (Tsukuba, Japan)*

_BelleDIRAC_
- Impacted development of the BelleDIRAC distributed framework for the Belle II grid and gbasf2 for the command-line client, amplifying users' experience to submit jobs to the Belle II grid
- Enhanced components handling **job submission, data transfer, and parsing and logging dataset objects** using the DIRAC API
- Optimized dataset logging by making it **20% faster to relay data transfer diagnostics** to the client by parsing dataset objects in JSON
- Improved the subsequent versions of BelleDIRAC by **decreasing job submission failures by 15%**, handling diagnostic data better, and unit testing components using _pytest_

_Shifts_
- Monitored the Belle II data production system, **accumulating 25+ hours of shifts** on the _B2MonitoringSystem_ web app
- **Investigated and logged the performance of grid sites** in data transfer, data processing, and MC (Monte Carlo) production resources

**Machine Learning Engineer**
  ~ 01/06/2023 - 01/09/2023

*IBM*
  ~ *Bengaluru, India*
- Engineered a data pipeline to pre-process music data from the *Google Magenta MAESTRO* dataset in MIDI format and generate music with a custom generative adversarial network (GAN)
- Yielded an **average log likelihood of -2, an Inception Score (IS) of 4.2, and a Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) of 68** by *batch normalization* of the training data and *dropout* as a regularization technique to boost the similarity between distributions
- Incorporated model inference into an API hosted on an IBM cloud server and **achieved a 62% increase in model response time and precision** over the previous generation music generation model on the cloud

## Projects

***What's Up Doc?* - Language Agnostic Code Documentation** 
  ~ *Python, Ollama, LLMs, TensorFlow, Transformers, Git*

- Designing a command-line tool named *whats-up-doc* to **automatically generate documentation** of a codebase using open-source large language models, *Ollama* and *LangChain*
- Fine-tuning the *codellama-2-7b model* on the *CodeLlama-2-20k* and *CodeSearchNet* datasets for Python, C++, and Java to produce a language-agnostic model that **achieves a baseline BLEU score of 32.2**
- Advancing code generation through exploring LLM quantization and pruning methods

<!-- <br><br> -->

***Splice and Dice* - Text Summarization with Transformers** 
  ~ *Python, Transformers, PyTorch, Streamlit, Git*

- Designed a custom T5 transformer architecture to **summarize academic and news articles in a web application** named _splice-and-dice_
- Fine-tuned the T5 model on the *Kaggle News Summary* dataset to **achieve a ROUGE score of 0.58**, translating to a **7% increase in ROUGE precision** compared to the pre-trained model on the *cnn_dailymail* dataset
- Deployed the fine-tuned T5 transformer model on a *Streamlit* web application, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for text summarization.

***Bulletin* - Project Management in Neovim** 
  ~ *Neovim, Lua, Linode, Shell Scripting, GitLab*

- Created a plugin for the command-line IDE Neovim during a college group project to **keep track of action items, bugs, and short-hand documentation directly in the Neovim development workspace**
- Integrated a module to **parse compiler warnings and errors** and log file paths automatically to the workspace's *bulletin*
- **Recorded a 66% surge in team productivity** from having the *bulletin* built into the editor, allowing us to **complete project development 3 weeks ahead of schedule**
